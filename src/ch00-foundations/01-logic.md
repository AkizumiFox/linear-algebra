# Logic and Quantifiers

Mathematical statements in linear algebra often involve claims about "all" vectors or the "existence" of a solution. For instance, saying a matrix equation \( \A\x = \mathbf{b} \) has a solution means *there exists* a vector \( \x \) satisfying the equation; saying a set is linearly independent means *for all* nontrivial linear combinations, the result is nonzero. To work with these statements precisely—especially when proving or disproving them—we need the language of **quantifiers**.

## Quantifiers

::: {#def-quantifiers}
[Quantifiers]

Let \( P(x) \) be a statement (predicate) that depends on a variable \( x \) ranging over some set \( S \).

- The **universal quantifier** \( \forall \) means "for all" or "for every." The statement
    \[
            \forall x \in S : P(x)
    \]
    asserts that \( P(x) \) is true for *every* element \( x \) in \( S \).

- The **existential quantifier** \( \exists \) means "there exists" or "for some." The statement
    \[
            \exists x \in S : P(x)
    \]
    asserts that \( P(x) \) is true for *at least one* element \( x \) in \( S \).

::: {.remark}
We sometimes write \( \forall x \in S, P(x) \) or \( (\forall x \in S)\, P(x) \) instead of \( \forall x \in S : P(x) \). The notation \( \exists! x \in S : P(x) \) means "there exists a **unique** \( x \) in \( S \) such that \( P(x) \)."

[Quantified Statements]

Consider the following statements:

1. \( \forall x \in \nR : x^2 \geq 0 \).

     This says "every real number squared is nonnegative." This is **true**.

2. \( \exists x \in \nR : x^2 = -1 \).

     This says "there exists a real number whose square is \( -1 \)." This is **false** in \( \nR \), but becomes true if we replace \( \nR \) with \( \nC \).

3. \( \forall x \in \nR : x < x + 1 \).

     This is **true** for all real numbers.

4. \( \exists n \in \nZ : n^2 = 2 \).

     This is **false**—there is no integer whose square is 2.

Quantifiers can be **nested**: statements may involve multiple quantifiers in sequence. The **order matters**.

::: {#exm-nested-quantifiers}
[Nested Quantifiers]

Consider these two statements about real numbers:

1. \( \forall x \in \nR, \exists y \in \nR : y > x \).

     "For every real number \( x \), there exists a real number \( y \) greater than \( x \)."
     This is **true**—given any \( x \), we can take \( y = x + 1 \).

2. \( \exists y \in \nR, \forall x \in \nR : y > x \).

     "There exists a real number \( y \) that is greater than all real numbers."
     This is **false**—no such largest real number exists.

The order of quantifiers changes the meaning entirely.

## Negating Quantified Statements

The key to proof by contradiction is knowing how to **negate** a statement. When negating quantified statements, there is a systematic rule: the universal quantifier becomes existential, and vice versa, while the predicate gets negated.

::: {#def-negation-of-quantifiers}
[Negation of Quantifiers]

The negation of a quantified statement follows these rules:
\[
        \neg(\forall x \in S : P(x)) \equiv \exists x \in S : \neg P(x)
\]
\[
        \neg(\exists x \in S : P(x)) \equiv \forall x \in S : \neg P(x)
\]

In words:

- "Not all \( x \) satisfy \( P \)" is equivalent to "there exists an \( x \) that does not satisfy \( P \)."
- "There does not exist an \( x \) satisfying \( P \)" is equivalent to "all \( x \) fail to satisfy \( P \)."

::: {#exm-negation-basic}
[Basic Negation Examples]

Here are two simple examples of negating quantified statements:

1. The negation of "\( \forall x \in \nR : x^2 \geq 0 \)" is "\( \exists x \in \nR : x^2 < 0 \)."

     The original is true; the negation is false.

2. The negation of "\( \exists n \in \nN : n \) is even" is "\( \forall n \in \nN : n \) is odd."

     The original is true (take \( n = 2 \)); the negation is false.

The following examples demonstrate how to negate definitions that you will encounter repeatedly in linear algebra.

::: {#exm-negation-injectivity}
[Negating the Definition of Injectivity]

Recall that a function \( f: A \to B \) is **injective** if:
\[
        \forall a_1, a_2 \in A : f(a_1) = f(a_2) \Rightarrow a_1 = a_2
\]

To prove \( f \) is **not** injective, we negate this statement. Since \( P \Rightarrow Q \) is equivalent to \( \neg P \lor Q \), its negation is \( P \land \neg Q \). Thus:
\[
        \exists a_1, a_2 \in A : f(a_1) = f(a_2) \land a_1 \neq a_2
\]

To show a function is not injective, find two **distinct** elements that map to the same value.
:::

::: {#exm-negation-surjectivity}
[Negating the Definition of Surjectivity]

A function \( f: A \to B \) is **surjective** if:
\[
        \forall b \in B, \exists a \in A : f(a) = b
\]

The negation is:
\[
        \exists b \in B, \forall a \in A : f(a) \neq b
\]

To prove \( f \) is **not** surjective, find a single element in the codomain that no element of the domain maps to.
:::

::: {.remark}
Mastering quantifier negation is essential for proof-based mathematics. Many proofs in linear algebra fall into one of the following patterns:

- Showing something holds for "all" vectors: use a direct proof starting with "let \( v \) be an arbitrary vector..."
- Showing something "exists": construct it explicitly, or use contradiction by assuming nothing exists.
- Disproving a "for all" statement: find a single counterexample.
- Disproving an "exists" statement: show that every candidate fails.
