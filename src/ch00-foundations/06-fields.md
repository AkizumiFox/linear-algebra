[Field]

A set \( F \) is called a **field** if we can define two binary operations addition \( + \), and multiplication \( \cdot \)
\[
	+ : F \times F \to F, \quad  \cdot : F \times F \to F
\]
such that:

::: {.enumerate options="label=(F\arabic*)"}
1. \( a + b = b + a \)
2. \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \)
3. There exists \( 0 \in F \) such that \( a + 0 = a \).
4. For every \( a \in F \), there exists \( -a \in F \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 \).
5. \( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \)
6. \( a \cdot b = b \cdot a \)
7. There exists \( 1 \in F \) such that \( 1 \neq 0 \) and \( a \cdot 1 = a \).
8. For every \( a \in F \setminus \{0\} \), there exists \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that \( a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 \).
9. \( a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \)

::: {.remark}
We can shorten "\( F \) is a field with operations \( + \) and \( \cdot \)" to "\( (F, +, \cdot) \) is a field". Moreover when the context of \( + \) and \( \cdot \) is clear, we simply say "\( F \) is a field", which we will do most of the time in this book.

[Examples of Fields]

The following sets are examples (and non-examples) of fields:

1. \( \nR \) is a field.

2. \( \nC \) is a field.

3. \( \nQ = \left\{ \frac{p}{q} : p, q \in \nZ,\; q \neq 0 \right\} \) is a field.

4. \( \nZ \) is **not** a field since **(F8)** fails.

5. \( M_n(\nR) \) is **not** a field since **(F6)** fails.

[Finite Fields]

Let \( \nF_n \) be the finite field with \( n \) elements. Then \( (\nF_2, +, \cdot) \) is defined to be:
\[
	F_2 = \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}, \quad \begin{array}{c|cc}
	    + & 0 & 1 \\
	    \hline
	    0 & 0 & 1 \\
	    1 & 1 & 0
	\end{array}, \quad \begin{array}{c|cc}
	\cdot & 0 & 1 \\
	\hline
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	1 & 0 & 1
	\end{array}.
\]

Then one can verify that \( (\nF_2, +, \cdot) \) is a field.
