# Subspaces

Some vector spaces might be "too big" and be unwieldy to deal with. Therefore, it is often convenient to look at "smaller vector spaces" inside a given vector space. These are called **subspaces**.

## Definition and the Subspace Test

::: {#def-subspace}
[Subspace]

Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( F \). A subset \( W \) of \( V \) is called a **subspace** of \( V \), if \( W \) is also a vector space over \( F \) with addition and scalar multiplication inherited from \( V \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Let \( (V, +, \cdot) \) be a vector space over \( F \), and \( W \subseteq V \). If \( (W, +, \cdot) \) is also a vector space over \( F \) then \( W \) is a subspace of \( V \).
:::

::: {#exm-trivial-subspaces}
[Trivial Subspaces]

Given a vector space \( V \), then

- \( V \) is a subspace of \( V \) itself;
- \( \left\{ \mathbf{0} \right\} \) is a subspace of \( V \) (also known as the "zero subspace");
- \( \varnothing \) is **not** a subspace of \( V \).
:::

::: {#thm-subspace-test}
[Subspace Test]

Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( F \) and \( W \subseteq V \). Then \( W \) is a subspace of \( V \) if and only if the following are satisfied:

- \( W \) is non-empty;
- \( W \) is closed under addition: \( \w_1 + \w_2 \in W \) for all \( \w_1, \w_2 \in W \);
- \( W \) is closed under scalar multiplication: \( \alpha \w \in W \) for all \( \alpha \in F \) and \( \w \in W \).
:::

::: {.proof}
\( (\Rightarrow) \) If \( W \) is a subspace, then \( W \) is a vector space, so it contains the zero vector (hence non-empty) and is closed under addition and scalar multiplication by definition.

\( (\Leftarrow) \) Assume the three conditions hold. Since \( W \subseteq V \), the operations on \( W \) are inherited from \( V \), so associativity, commutativity, and distributivity are automatically satisfied. It remains to verify the existence of identity elements and inverses.

- **Zero vector:** Since \( W \neq \varnothing \), there exists \( \w \in W \). By closure under scalar multiplication, \( 0 \cdot \w = \mathbf{0} \in W \).
- **Additive inverse:** For any \( \w \in W \), closure under scalar multiplication gives \( (-1) \cdot \w = -\w \in W \).

Thus \( W \) is a vector space under the inherited operations, i.e., a subspace of \( V \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that from the proof, the first condition of the Subspace Test can be replaced by the requirement that \( W \) contains the zero vector of \( V \).
:::

::: {.remark}
In practice, to test whether a given subset of a vector space is a subspace, we use @thm-subspace-test instead of checking all eight vector space axioms from scratch, which is much less tedious.
Moreover, some introductory textbooks use @thm-subspace-test as the definition of a subspace. While this is logically equivalent, it can be somewhat less intuitive than defining a subspace as a subset that is itself a vector space.

## Examples of Subspaces

::: {#exm-line-subspace}
[Line as Subspace]

\( W = \left\{ (x, y) \in \nR^2 : x + 2y = 0 \right\} \) is a subspace of \( \nR^2 \). Indeed:

- **Zero vector:** \( (0, 0) \in W \) since \( 0 + 2(0) = 0 \).
- **Addition:** If \( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \in W \), then \( (x_1+x_2) + 2(y_1+y_2) = (x_1+2y_1) + (x_2+2y_2) = 0 + 0 = 0 \), so their sum is in \( W \).
- **Scalar multiplication:** If \( (x, y) \in W \) and \( c \in \nR \), then \( (cx) + 2(cy) = c(x+2y) = c(0) = 0 \), so \( c(x, y) \in W \).
:::

::: {#exm-line-not-subspace}
[Translated Line is Not a Subspace]

\( W = \left\{ (x, y) \in \nR^2 : x + 2y = 3 \right\} \) is **not** a subspace of \( \nR^2 \). This is because it does not contain the zero vector: \( 0 + 2(0) = 0 \neq 3 \), so \( (0, 0) \notin W \).
:::

::: {#exm-poly-degree-bound}
[Polynomials of Bounded Degree]

Let \( F[x] \) be the vector space of all polynomials over a field \( F \). For a fixed \( n \in \nN \), the set \( F[x]_{\leq n} \) of polynomials of degree at most \( n \) is a subspace of \( F[x] \).

- **Zero vector:** The zero polynomial has degree \( -\infty \), so \( 0 \in F[x]_{\leq n} \).
- **Addition:** If \( \deg p \leq n \) and \( \deg q \leq n \), then \( \deg(p+q) \leq \max(\deg p, \deg q) \leq n \).
- **Scalar multiplication:** If \( \deg p \leq n \) and \( c \in F \), then \( \deg(cp) \leq \deg p \leq n \).
:::

::: {#exm-poly-exact-degree}
[Polynomials of Exact Degree]

The set \( F[x]_{=n} \) of polynomials of degree **exactly** \( n \) is **not** a subspace of \( F[x] \).

- It does not contain the zero vector (since \( \deg 0 = -\infty \neq n \)).
- It is not closed under addition. For example, if \( p(x) = x^n + x \) and \( q(x) = -x^n \), both have degree \( n \), but \( p(x) + q(x) = x \), which has degree \( 1 \neq n \) (assuming \( n > 1 \)).
:::

::: {#exm-differentiable-functions}
[Differentiable Functions]

Let \( C(\nR) = \{f : \nR \to \nR \mid f \text{ is continuous}\} \) be the set of all continuous functions on \( \nR \). We consider the set of differentiable functions:
\[
	D(\nR) = \{ f : \nR \to \nR \mid f \text{ is differentiable} \}
\]
To verify that \( D(\nR) \) is a subspace of \( C(\nR) \):

- **Subset:** Since differentiability implies continuity, we have \( D(\nR) \subseteq C(\nR) \).
- **Zero vector:** The zero function \( f(x) = 0 \) is differentiable, so \( \mathbf{0} \in D(\nR) \).
- **Closure under addition:** If \( f, g \in D(\nR) \), then \( f+g \) is differentiable with \( (f+g)' = f' + g' \), so \( f+g \in D(\nR) \).
- **Closure under scalar multiplication:** If \( f \in D(\nR) \) and \( c \in \nR \), then \( cf \) is differentiable with \( (cf)' = c f' \), so \( cf \in D(\nR) \).

Thus, \( D(\nR) \) is a subspace of \( C(\nR) \).

::: {#exm-symmetric-matrices}
[Symmetric Matrices]

The set of all symmetric matrices in \( M_n(F) \), denoted by \( S_n(F) = \{ \A \in M_n(F) : \A = \A^{\top} \} \), is a subspace of \( M_n(F) \).

- **Zero vector:** The zero matrix \( \O \) is symmetric since \( \O^{\top} = \O \), so \( \O \in S_n(F) \).
- **Addition:** If \( \A, \B \in S_n(F) \), then \( (\A+\B)^{\top} = \A^{\top} + \B^{\top} = \A + \B \), so \( \A+\B \in S_n(F) \).
- **Scalar multiplication:** If \( \A \in S_n(F) \) and \( c \in F \), then \( (c\A)^{\top} = c\A^{\top} = c\A \), so \( c\A \in S_n(F) \).
:::

::: {#exm-trace-free-matrices}
[Trace-free Matrices]

The set of all trace-free matrices in \( M_n(F) \), denoted by \( W = \{ \A \in M_n(F) : \tr(\A) = 0 \} \), is a subspace of \( M_n(F) \).

- **Zero vector:** \( \tr(\O) = 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0 = 0 \), so \( \O \in W \).
- **Addition:** If \( \A, \B \in W \), then \( \tr(\A+\B) = \tr(\A) + \tr(\B) = 0 + 0 = 0 \), so \( \A+\B \in W \).
- **Scalar multiplication:** If \( \A \in W \) and \( c \in F \), then \( \tr(c\A) = c \tr(\A) = c(0) = 0 \), so \( c\A \in W \).

## Intersections and Unions

::: {#thm-intersection-subspaces}
[Intersection of Subspaces]

Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) be subspaces of a vector space \( V \). Then the intersection \( W_1 \cap W_2 \) is also a subspace of \( V \).
:::

::: {.proof}
We use the Subspace Test on \( W = W_1 \cap W_2 \):

- **Zero vector:** Since \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are subspaces, \( \mathbf{0} \in W_1 \) and \( \mathbf{0} \in W_2 \). Thus \( \mathbf{0} \in W_1 \cap W_2 \).
- **Closure under addition:** Let \( \w, \z \in W_1 \cap W_2 \). Then \( \w, \z \in W_1 \) and \( \w, \z \in W_2 \). Since \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are subspaces, they are closed under addition, so \( \w + \z \in W_1 \) and \( \w + \z \in W_2 \). Hence \( \w + \z \in W_1 \cap W_2 \).
- **Closure under scalar multiplication:** Let \( \w \in W_1 \cap W_2 \) and \( c \in F \). Then \( \w \in W_1 \) and \( \w \in W_2 \). Since \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are closed under scalar multiplication, \( c\w \in W_1 \) and \( c\w \in W_2 \). Hence \( c\w \in W_1 \cap W_2 \).

Since all three conditions of the Subspace Test are satisfied, \( W_1 \cap W_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Unlike the intersection, the **union** of two subspaces is not necessarily a subspace. For \( W_1 \cup W_2 \) to be a subspace, one subspace must be contained within the other (i.e., \( W_1 \subseteq W_2 \) or \( W_2 \subseteq W_1 \)).
:::

::: {#exm-union-axes}
[Union of Axes]

Consider the vector space \( V = \nR^2 \). Let \( W_1 \) be the \( x \)-axis and \( W_2 \) be the \( y \)-axis:
\[
	W_1 = \{ (x, 0) : x \in \nR \}, \quad W_2 = \{ (0, y) : y \in \nR \}.
\]
Both \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are subspaces of \( \nR^2 \). However, their union \( W_1 \cup W_2 \) is **not** a subspace because it is not closed under addition.

Indeed, \( (1, 0) \in W_1 \subseteq W_1 \cup W_2 \) and \( (0, 1) \in W_2 \subseteq W_1 \cup W_2 \), but their sum:
\[
	(1, 0) + (0, 1) = (1, 1)
\]
is not in \( W_1 \cup W_2 \) since \( (1, 1) \) is neither on the \( x \)-axis nor the \( y \)-axis.
:::

::: {#prp-union-subspaces}
[Union of Subspaces]

Let \( W_1, W_2 \) be subspaces of \( V \). Then \( W_1 \cup W_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \) if and only if \( W_1 \subseteq W_2 \) or \( W_2 \subseteq W_1 \).
:::

::: {.proof}
\( (\Leftarrow) \) If \( W_1 \subseteq W_2 \), then \( W_1 \cup W_2 = W_2 \), which is a subspace. Similarly, if \( W_2 \subseteq W_1 \), the union is \( W_1 \), which is also a subspace.

\( (\Rightarrow) \) We prove the contrapositive: if neither is contained in the other, then the union is not a subspace. Assume \( W_1 \not\subseteq W_2 \) and \( W_2 \not\subseteq W_1 \).

- Since \( W_1 \not\subseteq W_2 \), there exists a vector \( \u \in W_1 \) such that \( \u \notin W_2 \).
- Since \( W_2 \not\subseteq W_1 \), there exists a vector \( \v \in W_2 \) such that \( \v \notin W_1 \).

Consider the sum \( \w = \u + \v \). We show that \( \w \notin W_1 \cup W_2 \):

- If \( \w \in W_1 \), then \( \v = \w - \u \). Since \( \w \in W_1 \) and \( \u \in W_1 \), their difference \( \v \) must be in \( W_1 \) (by closure). But we chose \( \v \notin W_1 \), which is a contradiction.
- If \( \w \in W_2 \), then \( \u = \w - \v \). Since \( \w \in W_2 \) and \( \v \in W_2 \), their difference \( \u \) must be in \( W_2 \). But we chose \( \u \notin W_2 \), which is a contradiction.

Therefore, \( \u + \v \) is in neither \( W_1 \) nor \( W_2 \), so it is not in \( W_1 \cup W_2 \). Thus, the union is not closed under addition and is therefore not a subspace.
